# 🚀 Advanced Port Scanner v1.0

A Python-based Advanced Port Scanner designed for network reconnaissance, service enumeration, HTTP security analysis, TLS certificate inspection, and basic risk assessment.

---

## 📌 Overview

Advanced Port Scanner is a command-line cybersecurity tool developed for educational purposes and authorized security testing. It enables users to scan a target host for open TCP ports, identify running services, perform banner grabbing, analyze HTTP security configurations, inspect TLS certificates, and generate a basic risk assessment.

The project follows a modular architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend with additional networking and security features.
